# EcoPositive Bristol (REACT UI)

[ecoPositive Bristol](https://ecopositive-react-pp5-0012331e7023.herokuapp.com/) is a one stop directory championing Bristolâ€™s eco-conscious and socially responsible businesses.

Unlike other business directories, ecoPositive is focused on highlighting the environmental awareness and community engagement of a company's actions and ethos.

This is good for the company owner as this information is often buried in a website and not at the forefront of their profile or reputation.

Business owners are invited to list their company or business and highlight their eco-positive credentials from a list of 50 pre-determined options listed under group headings.

All users are able to view the directory and see the company details so they can quickly identify local companies that align with their own ecoPositive priorities whether they sign up or not.

Users are invited to sign up to endorse the companies that they support and comment on listed businesses so that other visitors to the site can see which businesses are popular.

All listed companies and businesses are held accountable by the community / customers / clients as users can choose to endorse companies that they have personal experience of, and comment on the company profile if they do not agree with the eco-credentials or description that the company has posted.

The goal of this REACT user interface is to provide an engaging and user-friendly front end website that users can interact wih in order to create, read, update and delete data in the [back end API](https://ecopositive-api-pp5-ba0d580957dc.herokuapp.com/admin/) and to ensure they get the most out of the site.

## UX Design

- Colour Palette
  - The colour palette for this application was largely inspired by the colours of nature and the tones in the background image.
    - These include:
      - #195829 - Dark green used for company names and headings. Inspired by foliage and nature.
      - #d69303 - Yellow/Orange consistently used to reference endorsements and other accents. A positive colour referencing sunshine.
      - #fafafa - Content background colour - a softer white to complement the other strong tones 
      - #679cb1 - Teal blue - referencing back to the ecoPositive logo  
      - #d0eee3 - Pale green to complement other stronger colours. Used for credentials.
      - #e1e2e0 - Pale grey used to balance out the pages with a lot of content.
      - #d9ecb7 - Pale citron colour to tie in with the brighter tones in the background image.

    ![Colour Palette for the Application](docs/readme-images/colour-palette.png)

- Background Image
  - The background image was opensource and then adapted to be more abstract so it would not distract the user. The colour and brightness of this image give an impression of sunshine and green leaves or grasses which fit with the theme of environmentally friendly and positive businesses.
  ![Background Image used throughout the application](docs/readme-images/bgimage.jpg)
- Typography
  - Consistent typography was used throughout the application. 
  - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the font familes used:
    - DMSans - a clean and easy to read sans-serif font used for all general text
    - Roboto Flex - A modern clean font which works well for bolder titels. Used for company names throughout the site.
- Icons
  - Consistent icons and colours were used throughout the application to represent certain elements:
   - Endorsements were represented throughout by the [Fontawesome 'award' icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/award?f=classic&s=solid)
   - The Comments count was depicted using the [Fontawesome 'comments' icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/comments?f=classic&s=regular)
   - All other icons used in the NavBar, AddCompany and DotsDropdown menu components were also imported from the free fontawesome library.

### Add Company Form (CompanyCreateForm.js)
<hr>

- Any authenticated user can submit a company to be considered for addition to the ecoPositive directory.
- Conditional rendering will only display the Add My Company link in the AddCompany banner if a user is logged in.
- A useRedirect(loggedOut) hook at the top of the form function provides defensive authorisation sending unauthenticated users back to the home page if they try to access the from from the url.
- Clicking on the Submit Company button creates the company in the api and redirects the user to the associated company detail page so they can add their company credentials.
- New companies are not approved and so are not included in the home page listing which only displays companies that have been approved for listing.
- Unapproved companies can be viewed by the company owner so they eco-credentials can be added without having to wait for the approval process to be completed. If they navigate away from the initial company page redirect, the new company will be accessible from their profile page.

![Screenshot of the Add Company Form](docs/readme-images/add-company-form.png)

![Screenshot of new company with no other details added](docs/readme-images/new-company.png)

### Edit Company Form (CompanyEditForm.js)
<hr>

- Conditional rendering displays the three dots dropdown menu to a comapny owner only.
- Clicking on the edit icon in the company sends the owner to the CompanyEditForm which is already pre-populated with the company data.
- Clicking on Submit Changes sends the updated company data to the api to be displayed in the firectory.
- Companies are initially approved to ensure that they fit the profile and eco-conscious criteria for being included in the directory, and that they have provided authentic company contact details.
- Company edits do not require approval so the company is listed with any new edits, but users are able to comment on any company to highlight any issues that they do not feel are correct.

![Screenshot of Edit Company Form as owner](docs/readme-images/edit-company-form.png)

### My ecoPositive Profile (ProfilePage.js)
<hr>

- Every authenticated user is automatically assigned a profile page accessible from the navbar.
- The link to the user's My ecoPositive profile is conditionally rendered, so is only visible to the authenticated user.
- Defensive authentication is built into the page with a redirect hook to send any casual user back to the home page if they try to access the page from a url link.
- If another authenticated user tries to access the profile page from a url link, the profile data for the logged in user (and not the user id in the url) is used to render the page.

![Screenshot of a Profile Page](docs/readme-images/profile-page-robin.png)

- The profile page includes four main sections:
  - **The main profile**
    - If a first name has been added to the profile data this is used as the greeting header
    - The number of companies submitted and the number of companies endorsed is listed at the top of the page
    - Conditional rendering is used to display appropriate messages to the user to encourage further engagement with the app

  ![Screenshot of main user profile section](docs/readme-images/main-profile.png)

  - **Own Companies**
    - A list of companies that the profile owner has submitted to the directory.
    - Conditional rendering is used to remove this section if there are no companies submitted.
    - A dark green border is used to differentiate this list from the other sections and references the colour used for all company names throughout the site.

  ![Screenshot of own companies section](docs/readme-images/own-companies.png)

  - **Endorsed Companies**
    - A list of companies that the profile owner has endorsed.
    - This provides the equivalent of a 'liked or favourites' list and enables the user to quickly view all the companies that they support. Essentially their own ecoPostive Directory.
    - When there are no endorsements to show, the container remains in place with a message to further encourage the user to endorse their first company.
    - A bright orange border is used for this container to reference the same colour that is used to display endorsemenets information throughout the site.

  ![Screenshot of endorsed companies section](docs/readme-images/endorsed-companies.png)

  - **Highly Recommended**
    - This is the same component that is displayed in the CompanyListPage which serves as the main directory.
    - The top three endorsed companies are listed here if viewing on a mobile device, or if on a desktop the top 5 endorsed companies are listed.
    - The top companies list is intended to provide inspiration for companies to have a look at.
    - As users endorse different companies at all times, the TopCompanies component should display a range of different companies.   

  ![Screenshot of highly recommended section](docs/readme-images/top-companies-mobile.png)

### Edit Profile Form (ProfileEditForm.js)
<hr>

- As the only person who can access the profile page is the current authenticated user, they can always see the three dots dropdown menu to edit or delete their profile.

![Screenshot of delete profile confirmation modal](docs/readme-images/delete-profile-modal.png)

### Admin Page (AdminPage.js)
<hr>

- This page is only accessible by authenticated users with the is-staff status assigned to them.
- The Staff Only link in the navbar is conditionally rendered to display only if the current user is_admin.
- Further conditional rendering checks that the current user is_admin before rendering the content in the page.
- The admin page is a parent component that has two child components nested within it.

  - **New Companies (NewCompany.js)**
    - The New Companies section fetches a list of all companies that are not yet approved and lists each one within a NewCompany component.
    - If the company is not approved, the admin staff can contact the company owner outside of the admin page processed to discuss what is required to be approved.
    - Each NewCompany component includes:
      - Company Name - links to the company page to be reviewed for approval
      - Data added - the date that the company was submitted
      - Approve button - Clicking on this button updates the approved boolean for the company instance to true.
 
  ![Screenshot of admin page](docs/readme-images/admin-page.png)

  - **Reported Comments (ReportedComment.js)**
    - The Reported Comments section fetches a list of all comments that have been reported so they can be reviewed by an admin.
    - Clicking on the Approve button resets the reported boolean back to false so that the comment can be listed in the original location.
    - Clicking on Delete renders a confirmation modal for the admin to confirm if the comment should be deleted.
    - The handleDelete function also reduces the comment count for that company instance by 1.
    - Each comment is rendered into a ReportedComment component which includes:
      - Company Name - this links to the company page so the admin can view the context of the comment in relation to other comments.
      - The commenter username and avatar. The avatar is not shown on small devices to ensure that the page is fully responsive.
      - The comment content for review
      - The period of time since the comment was made
      - An approve button {handleApprove} and a delete button {handleDelete}.

  ![Screenshot of delete confirmation modal](docs/readme-images/delete-comment-modal.png)

### Page Not Found (PageNotFound.js)
<hr>

- This page is a catch-all route for any url configuration with the base url, but for an unrecognised page.
- The home icon and text link back to the home page so the user has the option to go there or choose a different page.

![Screenshot of page not found content](docs/readme-images/page-not-found.png)

### Future Features
<hr>

- There are several future features that would enhance this application. If I had more time and knowledge I would like to:
  - Embed a Google map for the company address -  This would enable users to find their way to a company location.
  - Filter the home page list by credential group - the user can choose one of the four groups and see all companies listed with that credential group. The filter for this exists in the api, but I was unable to find suitable guidance resources to help me implement this in the time available.
  - Nominate a company - Any user could nominate a company not included in the directory so that the admin can contact the company to tell them they have been nominated by a potential customer and invite them to join the ecoPositive revolution!
  - Credentials Page - a page listing all of the credentials with some information on each and links to further information where available. The Credential model is already set up with this potential development in mind.

### Other Features
<hr>

- **Infinite Scrolling** 
  - Both the directory homepage and comments sections utilize infinite scrolling, providing users with a seamless browsing experience. As users scroll through companies or comments, additional content is dynamically loaded, eliminating the need for manual pagination and allowing for smooth navigation through extensive collections of content.

- **Real-time Updates**
  - The application incorporates real-time updates for various interactions such as comments and endorsements.

- **Responsive Design** 
  - ecoPositive is built with a responsive design approach, ensuring optimal performance and usability across a range of devices and screen sizes. Whether accessed from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, users can enjoy a consistent and intuitive experience without sacrificing functionality.

- **Enhanced Security** 
  - The platform prioritizes user data security with robust encryption protocols and regular security audits. User authentication, data transmission, and storage are handled securely to protect sensitive information and ensure user privacy.

- **Accessibility Features** 
  - ecoPositive is designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to web accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity for users with disabilities. Features such as screen reader compatibility and alternative text for images are implemented to facilitate an accessible experience for all users.

## Design Process

- The full process for planning and setting up the project is outlined in the README for the [ecoPositive REST API](https://github.com/sophie-thomson/ecopositive-bristol-drf/)

### User Stories
<hr>

- One of the first tasks was to map out user stories for the project which could be mapped against EPICS and broken down into tasks. These were initially worked through in an excel spreadsheet and worked into a rough working order based on the Moments walkthrough project build.

- All user stories can be seen in the [user-stories pdf version of the spreadsheet](docs/readme-images/user-stories.pdf)

![Screenshot of user-stories spreadsheet](docs/readme-images/userstories-screenshot.png)

### Agile Methodology

- Following the principles outlined in the Code Institute Agile Working units, I created a GitHub Kanban Board and using Project Issues, Milestones and Labels I mapped out the ecoPositive Bristol user stories into:
   - EPICS (Overarching blocks of work broken down into USER STORY Issues)
   - To Do (USER STORY issues with acceptance criteria and tasks)
   - In Progress (USER STORY Issues in progress during each Milestone or 'Sprint')
   - Completed (USER STORY Issues that have been completed)
   - BUGS (BUG issues that define a particular issue encountered during the project and how it was resolved)

Full details of the kanban board and further working Agile Processes can be found in the README for the back end [ecoPositive REST API](https://github.com/sophie-thomson/ecopositive-bristol-drf/)

![Screenshot of GitHub Kanban Board](docs/readme-images/kanban-board.png)

- View the live [ecoPositive Bristol Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/sophie-thomson/projects/4/)

### Data

***Models***

- The next step was to plan and devise an ERD for each of my database models and a schema to map out and understand the relationships between them. I created an ERD and model schema for the project and the data structured required for the UI to work.

You can view all ERDs and the full schema in the [back end ecoPositive API](https://ecopositive-api-pp5-ba0d580957dc.herokuapp.com/admin/) README.

***User Authentication***

Throughout the site, conditional rendering and fetchData filtering methods are used to ensure that the content rendered is accordant with the authentication profile for that user.

There are three main user authentication levels:
- **Casual User**
    - Any user who visits the site and is not logged in.
- **Authenticated User**
    - A user who has signed up to the site and successfully logged in.
- **Authenticated Admin**
    - An authenticated user who has been given is_staff status in the api admin dashboard (accessible by superusers only).

In addition to the above general authentication levels: 
- **is_owner**
    - Checks if the current authenticated user is the owner of that particular instance. Conditional rendering is then used to display elements which are only accessible by the instance owner.

### Wireframes

- Initial Wireframe designs were used to plan out the layout for the CompanyList and CompanyPage. These views are visible to all users whether logged in or not.

![Directory Listing Wireframe Design](docs/readme-images/home-page-laptop.png)

![Company Detail Wireframe Design](docs/readme-images/company-details-laptop.png)

## Testing

### Automated Testing (NavBar.tests.js)
<hr>

- Based on the guidance provided in the Moment walkthrough, a small number of automated tests using the REACT Testing Library were carries out to ensure that navigation links were rendered as expected for logged in and logged out users.
- Tests include:
  -  test 1 & 2 - "renders NavBar" - testing for Sign In and Browse Links being rendered
  - test 3 - "renders link to the user profile for a logged in user" - testing for My Ecopositive profile link
  - test 4 & 5 - "renders Sign In and Sign Up buttons again on log out" - testing that the Sign In and Sign Up links render when Sign Out is clicked.

  - Testing was inconsistent and although I was able to pass all tests when first written, at a later date the tests failed. I was unable to discover the reason for this, but have left the tests in place as evidence of knowledge.

### Manual Testing
<hr>

- All aspects of the ecoPositive site were manually tested by walking through each of the features and actions outlined above and using screenshots to document the outcome to confirm it is as expected.

- In addition to the above walkthrough evidence a more systematic approach to testing against each of the user stories in the original spreadsheet was used to check that all key functionality and links are working correctly with no significant errors displaying in the DevTools console.

- Methodical User Story testing was carried out and the results recorded in a Testing spreadsheet. [View the full document](docs/readme-images/user-story-TESTING.pdf) in the attached documents folder.

### Validation

- All javaScript JSX code was built with ESLint installed in the IDE (GitPod) and tested at the end of the build with no errors.

![Screenshot of ESLint results](docs/readme-images/ESLint-passed.png)

- Each file / module of css code was passed through the [W3C Jigsaw CSS Vaidation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and all errors resolved so that all code passed with No Errors Found.

- The deployed site was passed through [W3C HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) with no errors. Some warning were raised due to the trailing slash used in JSX, so I did not try to resolve these. All other standard HTML code passed with no errors.

- The [Wave compatibility site](https://wave.webaim.org/) didn't seem to be able to view the site to assess it, but accessible design was present throughout the application with alt text and aria code used wherever applicable, and good contrast used for all text against the background. Clear intention and messaging for all buttons and calls to action were used to ensure that the site is easy to navigate and user friendly.

## Heroku Deployment
<hr>

Both the back end Django REST API and this front end REACT UI were deployed to Heroku to test as a published site. The steps to deploy the ecoPositive REST Api are detailed in the [project README](https://github.com/sophie-thomson/ecopositive-bristol-drf/). Deploying the front end UI is a similar process, but there are no ConfigVars required to be set as all the data is managed in the back end. 

The finished program was initially hosted within a repository on Github, and then this Github repository was connected with Heroku, the site through which the program is deployed.

***How to Deploy to Heroku***

The steps to deploy to Heroku are as follows:

- Ensure that all changed to the models have been migrated by typing the following command into the terminal: python3 manage.py makemigrations
    - If there are migrations made, type the following command into the terminal: python3 manage.py migrate
- Ensure that you have a file in your program file directory called: requirements.txt 
- Ensure that all imported libraries that are used in your program are listed in the requirements.txt file.
    - To add any new libraries, type the following command into the terminal: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
- Collect all static files for your project by typing the following command into the terminal: python3 manage.py collectstatic
    - Type 'yes' if you have already collected static files before. This will overwrite previous files.
- Ensure you have installed gunicorn and that you have a Procfile file (has no file extension) which includes a single line of code: web: gunicorn tastesensation_project.wsgi
- Ensure that the DEBUG setting in settings.py is set to 'False'.
- Use **git add .** then **git commit -m "Commit message."** and then **git push** to push all latest changes into the relevant repository on Github.
- Go to the [Heroku Website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and log in by clicking on the link in the top right corner of the screen.
    - Sign up for a new Heroku account if needed. 
    - Please note you will need to add a payment card before Heroku will allow you to deploy any project. 
    - To do this you will need to click on your account profile in the top right corner and click on Account Settings, then select the Billing tab and follow the instructions to add a credit card. 
- Once logged in, click on the **'New'** drop down menu at the top of your dashboard and select **'Create new app'**
- Choose a name for your app ideally using the same conventions as your project name in your Github repository
- Select the region that you are located in from the options shown
- Ignore the Add to pipeline... button and click on **'Create app'**
- Select the **'Settings'** tab at the top of the screen and scroll to the Config Vars section
- Click on **'Reveal Config Vars'** and if you have an env.py file with confidential information add these as Config Variables here. 
- This front end project doesn't include any sensitive information as this is handled by the back end API project.
- Once all Config Vars are in place scroll back to the top of the page and click on the 'Deploy' tab.
- In the Deployment Method section, select Github and confirm that you want to connect to Github.
- In the 'Search for a repository to connect to' type in the name of the repository that you want to deploy and click **'Search'**.
- Click on the **'Connect'** button next to the correct Github repository in the search results
- Scroll down to select whether you would like to deploy automatically (Heroku will build a new app every time you push new updates through to the Github repository), or whether you would like to deploy manually at less regular intervals when you wish to check or test something.
- Click on **'Deploy Branch'** (ensure that the branch selected is 'main') to deploy manually when you want to.
- Heroku will build your app and will then display a 'View' button at the bottom of the screen.
- Click **'View'** to see your deployed project!

### Gitpod Version Control
<hr>

This site was created using the Gitpod cloud development environment before being pushed through to a dedicated repository on Github.

The following commands were used througout development to push the code through to the Github repo:

- **git add .** - This command was used to add any tracked files to the staging area.
- **git commit -m "Commit message."** - This command was used to create a snapshot of the staged area with a short description.
- **git push** - This command was used to push the committed changes from the current branch to the remote repository on Github.

### Run Locally
<hr>

Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

- Click on the code drop down button
- Click on HTTPS
- Copy the repository link to the clipboard
- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now have been cloned on your local machine for use.

Install Dependencies:

```npm install```

Run Application:

```npm start```

### Forking

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

- On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

- This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.
