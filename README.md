![Directory Listing Wireframe Design](docs/readme-images/home-page-laptop.png)

![Company Detail Wireframe Design](docs/readme-images/company-details-laptop.png)

***Models***

- The next step was to plan and devise an ERD for each of my database models and a schema to map out and understand the relationships between them. I created an ERD and model schema for the project based on all of the elements that I would like to include if I was able (this included the Should Have and Could Have User Story issues).

You can view all ERDs and the full schema in the README for the drf API part of the EcoPositive project.
