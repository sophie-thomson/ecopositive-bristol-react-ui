# EcoPositive Bristol (REACT UI)

[ecoPositive Bristol](https://ecopositive-react-pp5-0012331e7023.herokuapp.com/) is a one stop directory championing Bristolâ€™s eco-conscious and socially responsible businesses.

Unlike other business directories, ecoPositive is focused on highlighting the environmental awareness and community engagement of a company's actions and ethos.

This is good for the company owner as this information is often buried in a website and not at the forefront of their profile or reputation.

Business owners are invited to list their company or business and highlight their eco-positive credentials from a list of 50 pre-determined options listed under group headings.

All users are able to view the directory and see the company details so they can quickly identify local companies that align with their own ecoPositive priorities whether they sign up or not.

Users are invited to sign up to endorse the companies that they support and comment on listed businesses so that other visitors to the site can see which businesses are popular.

All listed companies and businesses are held accountable by the community / customers / clients as users can choose to endorse companies that they have personal experience of, and comment on the company profile if they do not agree with the eco-credentials or description that the company has posted.

The goal of this REACT user interface is to provide an engaging and user-friendly front end website that users can interact wih in order to create, read, update and delete data in the [back end API](https://ecopositive-api-pp5-ba0d580957dc.herokuapp.com/admin/) and to ensure they get the most out of the site.

### Agile Methodology

### Data

***Models***

- The next step was to plan and devise an ERD for each of my database models and a schema to map out and understand the relationships between them. I created an ERD and model schema for the project and the data structured required for the UI to work.

You can view all ERDs and the full schema in the [back end ecoPositive API](https://ecopositive-api-pp5-ba0d580957dc.herokuapp.com/admin/) README.

***User Authentication***

Throughout the site, conditional rendering and fetchData filtering methods are used to ensure that the content rendered is accordant with the authentication profile for that user.

There are three main user authentication levels:
- **Casual User**
    - Any user who visits the site and is not logged in.
- **Authenticated User**
    - A user who has signed up to the site and successfully logged in.
- **Authenticated Admin**
    - An authenticated user who has been given is_staff status in the api admin dashboard (accessible by superusers only).

In addition to the above general authentication levels: 
- **is_owner**
    - Checks if the current authenticated user is the owner of that particular instance. Conditional rendering is then used to display elements which are only accessible by the instance owner.

### Wireframes

- Initial Wireframe designs were used to plan out the layout for the CompanyList and CompanyPage. These views are visible to all users whether logged in or not.
