# EcoPositive Bristol (REACT UI)

[ecoPositive Bristol](https://ecopositive-react-pp5-0012331e7023.herokuapp.com/) is a one stop directory championing Bristolâ€™s eco-conscious and socially responsible businesses.

Unlike other business directories, ecoPositive is focused on highlighting the environmental awareness and community engagement of a company's actions and ethos.

This is good for the company owner as this information is often buried in a website and not at the forefront of their profile or reputation.

Business owners are invited to list their company or business and highlight their eco-positive credentials from a list of 50 pre-determined options listed under group headings.

All users are able to view the directory and see the company details so they can quickly identify local companies that align with their own ecoPositive priorities whether they sign up or not.

Users are invited to sign up to endorse the companies that they support and comment on listed businesses so that other visitors to the site can see which businesses are popular.

All listed companies and businesses are held accountable by the community / customers / clients as users can choose to endorse companies that they have personal experience of, and comment on the company profile if they do not agree with the eco-credentials or description that the company has posted.

The goal of this REACT user interface is to provide an engaging and user-friendly front end website that users can interact wih in order to create, read, update and delete data in the [back end API](https://ecopositive-api-pp5-ba0d580957dc.herokuapp.com/admin/) and to ensure they get the most out of the site.

- Any authenticated user can submit a company to be considered for addition to the ecoPositive directory.
- Conditional rendering will only display the Add My Company link in the AddCompany banner if a user is logged in.

- Clicking on the Submit Company button creates the company in the api and redirects the user to the associated company detail page so they can add their company credentials.
- New companies are not approved and so are not included in the home page listing which only displays companies that have been approved for listing.

![Screenshot of new company with no other details added](docs/readme-images/new-company.png)

### Edit Company Form (CompanyEditForm.js)

![Screenshot of Edit Company Form as owner](docs/readme-images/edit-company-form.png)

### My ecoPositive Profile (ProfilePage.js)
<hr>

- Every authenticated user is automatically assigned a profile page accessible from the navbar.
- The link to the user's My ecoPositive profile is conditionally rendered, so is only visible to the authenticated user.
- Defensive authentication is built into the page with a redirect hook to send any casual user back to the home page if they try to access the page from a url link.
- If another authenticated user tries to access the profile page from a url link, the profile data for the logged in user (and not the user id in the url) is used to render the page.

![Screenshot of a Profile Page](docs/readme-images/profile-page-robin.png)

- The profile page includes four main sections:
  - **The main profile**
    - If a first name has been added to the profile data this is used as the greeting header
    - The number of companies submitted and the number of companies endorsed is listed at the top of the page
    - Conditional rendering is used to display appropriate messages to the user to encourage further engagement with the app

  ![Screenshot of main user profile section](docs/readme-images/main-profile.png)

  - **Own Companies**
    - A list of companies that the profile owner has submitted to the directory.
    - Conditional rendering is used to remove this section if there are no companies submitted.
    - A dark green border is used to differentiate this list from the other sections and references the colour used for all company names throughout the site.

  ![Screenshot of own companies section](docs/readme-images/own-companies.png)

  - **Endorsed Companies**
    - A list of companies that the profile owner has endorsed.
    - This provides the equivalent of a 'liked or favourites' list and enables the user to quickly view all the companies that they support. Essentially their own ecoPostive Directory.
    - When there are no endorsements to show, the container remains in place with a message to further encourage the user to endorse their first company.
    - A bright orange border is used for this container to reference the same colour that is used to display endorsemenets information throughout the site.

  ![Screenshot of endorsed companies section](docs/readme-images/endorsed-companies.png)

  - **Highly Recommended**
    - This is the same component that is displayed in the CompanyListPage which serves as the main directory.
    - The top three endorsed companies are listed here if viewing on a mobile device, or if on a desktop the top 5 endorsed companies are listed.
    - The top companies list is intended to provide inspiration for companies to have a look at.
    - As users endorse different companies at all times, the TopCompanies component should display a range of different companies.   

  ![Screenshot of highly recommended section](docs/readme-images/top-companies-mobile.png)

### Edit Profile Form (ProfileEditForm.js)
<hr>

- As the only person who can access the profile page is the current authenticated user, they can always see the three dots dropdown menu to edit or delete their profile.

### Admin Page (AdminPage.js)
<hr>

- This page is only accessible by authenticated users with the is-staff status assigned to them.
- The Staff Only link in the navbar is conditionally rendered to display only if the current user is_admin.
- Further conditional rendering checks that the current user is_admin before rendering the content in the page.
- The admin page is a parent component that has two child components nested within it.

  - **New Companies (NewCompany.js)**
    - The New Companies section fetches a list of all companies that are not yet approved and lists each one within a NewCompany component.
    - If the company is not approved, the admin staff can contact the company owner outside of the admin page processed to discuss what is required to be approved.
    - Each NewCompany component includes:
      - Company Name - links to the company page to be reviewed for approval
      - Data added - the date that the company was submitted
      - Approve button - Clicking on this button updates the approved boolean for the company instance to true.
 
  ![Screenshot of admin page](docs/readme-images/admin-page.png)

  - **Reported Comments (ReportedComment.js)**
    - The Reported Comments section fetches a list of all comments that have been reported so they can be reviewed by an admin.
    - Clicking on the Approve button resets the reported boolean back to false so that the comment can be listed in the original location.
    - Clicking on Delete renders a confirmation modal for the admin to confirm if the comment should be deleted.
    - The handleDelete function also reduces the comment count for that company instance by 1.
    - Each comment is rendered into a ReportedComment component which includes:
      - Company Name - this links to the company page so the admin can view the context of the comment in relation to other comments.
      - The commenter username and avatar. The avatar is not shown on small devices to ensure that the page is fully responsive.
      - The comment content for review
      - The period of time since the comment was made
      - An approve button {handleApprove} and a delete button {handleDelete}.

  ![Screenshot of delete confirmation modal](docs/readme-images/delete-comment-modal.png)

### Page Not Found (PageNotFound.js)
<hr>

- This page is a catch-all route for any url configuration with the base url, but for an unrecognised page.
- The home icon and text link back to the home page so the user has the option to go there or choose a different page.

![Screenshot of page not found content](docs/readme-images/page-not-found.png)

### Future Features

## Design Process

### User Stories

### Agile Methodology

### Data

***Models***

- The next step was to plan and devise an ERD for each of my database models and a schema to map out and understand the relationships between them. I created an ERD and model schema for the project and the data structured required for the UI to work.

You can view all ERDs and the full schema in the [back end ecoPositive API](https://ecopositive-api-pp5-ba0d580957dc.herokuapp.com/admin/) README.

***User Authentication***

Throughout the site, conditional rendering and fetchData filtering methods are used to ensure that the content rendered is accordant with the authentication profile for that user.

There are three main user authentication levels:
- **Casual User**
    - Any user who visits the site and is not logged in.
- **Authenticated User**
    - A user who has signed up to the site and successfully logged in.
- **Authenticated Admin**
    - An authenticated user who has been given is_staff status in the api admin dashboard (accessible by superusers only).

In addition to the above general authentication levels: 
- **is_owner**
    - Checks if the current authenticated user is the owner of that particular instance. Conditional rendering is then used to display elements which are only accessible by the instance owner.

### Wireframes

- Initial Wireframe designs were used to plan out the layout for the CompanyList and CompanyPage. These views are visible to all users whether logged in or not.
